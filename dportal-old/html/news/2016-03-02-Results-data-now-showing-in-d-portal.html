#blog_body form=markdown

Following requests from users about showing Results data in IATI with in d-portal you can now see this on the individual activity (<i>Savi</i>) pages â€“ if you drill down into the data through the chart and tables, or via the maps, to see an individual activity you should be able to scroll down past the details of individual transactions within that activity and see information on Results (<i>as long as the publisher has reported Results data in their xml!</i>).

For example on this Savi page for a <a href="http://d-portal.org/ctrack.html?publisher=NL-KVK-41160054&tongue=eng#view=act&aid=NL-KVK-41160054-109805">Cordaid activity</a> on improving health care in Zimbabwe you can see the Results data that Cordaid have published for this activity...
