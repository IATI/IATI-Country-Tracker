The generator allows you to choose from a wide variety of ways to view IATI data within d-portal, and then provides a link for you to easily embed the content you’ve chosen into your own site – great if you want to display your own IATI data in an engaging way, or are looking to visualise other IATI data for analysis.  You can embed charts, tables, maps and various other content, all of which can then be clicked through to allow users to explore the data further in d-portal – and once it’s embedded in your site it will update automatically overnight!
