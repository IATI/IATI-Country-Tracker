#index_paragraph1_text
is a country-based information platform that tracks resource flows. It is aimed at providing line ministries, parliamentarians and civil society with information that can assist with the planning and monitoring of development activities.

#feedback_paragraph1_text
Hello, all and thank you for taking part as beta testers for d-portal.org. We welcome any and all feedback, suggestions and concerns you may have about the website so please feel free to post them as comments below. Overall, we want to focus on legibility and user experience, especially in terms of understanding the data that is being presented.

#feedback_paragraph2_text
Thank you very much for taking the time to do this! We hope to create something useful and easily deployable, an interesting talking point but most importantly, promote better data quality from reporting organisations.

#about_paragraph1_text
d-portal.org aims to be a simple user interface to search and browse all IATI data relating to a specific country.

#about_paragraph2_text
The final product will be available as a set of HTML, Javascript, and CSS files.

#about_paragraph3_text
Since HTML/CSS/Javascript are the technologies of the web, and are widely used and understood, we believe this is a good option for easy adoption by others, for easy deployment, and for easy re-configuration/customisation.

What is it?

#about_paragraph4_text
is a country-based information platform that tracks resource flows. It is aimed at providing line ministries, parliamentarians and civil society with information that can assist with the planning and monitoring of development activities.

#about_paragraph5_text
In its first iteration it contains current data published through the International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI) as well as the most recent (2012) data published by the 

#about_paragraph6_text
. Future development will include, inter alia, data from Aid Information Management Systems, national budgets and a range of comparable socio-economic indicators.

#about_paragraph7_text
In its first iteration the platform poses two questions: where do resources come from, and where do they go (by sector and location)? Recent, current and future data is presented and compared across data sources.

#about_paragraph8_text
In order to answer these questions from a country perspective it is insufficient merely to display available data: it is equally important to plot the gaps in the information. Coping with poor quality or missing data is an essential part of the information interface.

#about_paragraph9_text
is an open source platform. While it provides a generic deployment for any country it has been developed with the specific intention of being customised in-country to meet local needs. A prototype local application for Nepal is currently being developed in parallel with the core engine.

#about_paragraph10_text
has been jointly funded by

#about_paragraph11_text
and 

#about_paragraph12_text
. IATI is keen to promote the access to IATI-formatted data at country level. DI is committed to improving access to information by implementing joined-up data solutions.

#savi_paragraph1_text
SAVi is a simple activity viewer for IATI XML that you can view in real time, online, in your favourite browser.

#savi_paragraph2_text
SAVi uses CSS and javascript to display otherwise complex-looking XML into a format that is easier to read and digest.

#dstore_paragraph_text
dstore subsidizes the IATI Datastore with an optimized nodejs + SQLite version for use in real time queries.

#q_paragraph_text
