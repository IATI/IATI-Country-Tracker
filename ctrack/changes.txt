Activity View (2014-02-03 shi)
==============================
Added graphs for sectors with allocated percentages
Colour coded activity status
Added related-activity sorted by type
Added reporting-org
All links visible with hover states
Hierarchy for transactions sorting
Added commas to transaction value
Sectors default to DAC if undeclared


Activities styling js code now uses jquery.

activities.css styles raw xml data.

Switched to nodejs bake script, so we need nodejs installed to build 
the ctrack.min.js file.
