Activity View (2014-02-03 shi)
==============================
Added graphs for sectors with allocated values
Added related-activity
Added reporting-org
All links visible with hover states
Hierarchy for transactions sorting
Added commas to transaction value


Activities styling js code now uses jquery.

activities.css styles raw xml data.

Switched to nodejs bake script, so we need nodejs installed to build 
the ctrack.min.js file.
